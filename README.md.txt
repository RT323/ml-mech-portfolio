Machine Learning and Mechanical Engineering Portfolio

Hello! My name is Raghav Thyagarajan, and I am a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at the University of Washington with a strong interest in applying machine learning to physics-based engineering problems such as heat transfer, energy systems, and simulation-driven analysis.

This repository contains a curated set of projects where I apply machine learning techniques to mechanical engineering–related datasets and models, with an emphasis on physical interpretability, robustness, and clear engineering reasoning.

Projects:

1. Energy Efficiency Regression  
Predicting building heating load using supervised machine learning models.

- Applied linear regression and Random Forest models to predict heating load from building geometry and glazing parameters  
- Performed exploratory data analysis, cross-validation, and hyperparameter tuning  
- Analyzed bias–variance tradeoffs and model stability  
- Emphasized clear visualization and interpretable results

Status: Completed  

2. Heat Transfer Surrogate Modeling  
Physics-based machine learning surrogate for steady-state heat transfer.

- Generated synthetic data using an analytical conduction–convection heat transfer model  
- Trained linear and nonlinear surrogate models to approximate heat flux predictions  
- Evaluated model accuracy and robustness using cross-validation  
- Interpreted surrogate behavior through feature importance and sensitivity analysis  
- Demonstrated how machine learning can approximate physics-based models while preserving physical insight
