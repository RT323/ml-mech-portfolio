Machine Learning and Mechanical Engineering Portfolio

Hello! My name is Raghav Thyagarajan, and I am a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at the University of Washington interested in applying machine learning to engineering problems such as energy systems, manufacturing, and simulation.

This repository contains projects where I apply machine learning concepts to mechanical engineering–related datasets and models.

Projects:

1. Energy Efficiency Regression
Predicting heating and cooling load of buildings using supervised machine learning models.

- Folder: `projects/01-energy-efficiency-regression`
- Status: Completed

Tools & Skills:
- Python
- NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Git & GitHub
